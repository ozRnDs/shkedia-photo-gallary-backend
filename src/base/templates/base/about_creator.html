          Ever since I was little, computers and technology have surrounded me. From the age of 14, I taught myself web development,
          software development, and became a part of the online community. Products and complex systems intrigued me, leading me to
          study Mechanical Engineering for my Bachelor's Degree and Systems Engineering for my Master's Degree.

          Empowered with extensive experience in defining, developing, testing, and delivering products and systems, I have returned
          to the realm of software development. As an MLOps Engineer, I now design and implement complex Machine Learning systems
          and pipelines for critical missions. I prioritize delivering added value to clients and strive to find the fastest and
          most robust solutions.

          Project Shkedia is another significant step, leveraging the experience I have gathered over the years to cherish our
          family's memories.
